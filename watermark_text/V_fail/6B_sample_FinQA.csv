Why is property investment good if properties de-valuate over time?,"Property investment can be good even if properties de-value over time, because there are several factors that can contribute to this phenomenon. Firstly, the value of properties can be influenced by the overall economic conditions, such as inflation or a recession. During these times, the demand for properties may decrease, leading to a decrease in property values. However, property investment can provide a hedge against inflation, as the value of the property can appreciate over time. Additionally, properties can provide a steady stream of income through rental income, which can be used to offset the decrease in property value. Finally, property investment can provide a long-term investment opportunity, with the potential for capital appreciation, which can offset the potential decrease in property value over time.","
Investing in property can be good even if properties devalue over time, as long as the investor buys them at a reasonable price and holds them for the long term. The reasons for this are:

1. Renovation and appreciation: Over time, properties can become outdated, damaged, or in disrepair. By buying a property at a low price and investing in renovations, the investor can increase the value of the property over time. If the renovations are successful, the property may even appreciate, making the investment profitable.
2. Income generation: Rental properties can provide a steady stream of income. Even if the property's value is declining, the investor can still earn money from rent. This income can be used to pay off the mortgage and cover other expenses.
3. Diversification: Investing in property can diversify an investor's portfolio, reducing the impact of other investments on the overall portfolio. This can help to spread risk and protect against market volatility.
4. Long-term capital growth: Property investments can provide long-term capital growth if the investor buys at a low price and holds the property for a sufficient period. Over time, the value of the property can increase, providing a healthy return on investment.

In conclusion, investing in property can be good even if properties devalue over time, provided the investor is savvy and strategic in their approach.",1.11E+15,16,0
